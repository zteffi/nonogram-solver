#hobby project - solving [nonogram puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) 
Currently working on solving algorithm.

Future plans include using images as an input. However [tesseract doesn't work well on tables right now](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality.html#tables-recognition), so that might be a challenge too.
